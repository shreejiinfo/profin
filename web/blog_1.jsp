                                                    <strong class="color1">	Transparency will become the most important tool of marketing.</strong></p>
                                                                    <p>According to Dan, “Next year the best brands won’t be those with the best stories, or made up fictional stories, but those that will give an accurate and real time picture of what they are doing in the interest of the consumer, at any given time.” 

Completely agree. The more marketers are able to show end consumers what’s involved in the processes behind their organization, product, or service, the more likely they are to capture an audience. Digital asset management solutions add to this transparency by giving organizations – big and small – complete transparency into where their assets live and how they’re being used. 

Allowing your photos, videos, audio files, or layout and graphic files to be held hostage by third party vendors, or on your own servers, is a major marketing setback. Your organization deserves complete visibility into your assets. After all, it’s the only way to understand which brand assets add the most value to your marketing, to repurpose successful and stand-out assets, and to manage image rights associated with your assets. 

Solutions with asset analytics let you dive deep into user activity and help you make data driven decisions about your marketing campaigns, rather than blindly moving forward based on previous marketing budgets and plans.</p>
                                                                 
                                                                 <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">We will witness the emergence of the marketing technologists.</strong></p>
                                                                 <p>“The best marketer in a digital world would be the marketing technologists, people with heavy digital DNA and technology acumen.”

Fondly referred to as “unicorns” today, these tech savvy, data-driven marketers will become a more common breed in the future. And many of them will be the people managing the core business solutions within your organization’s marketing ecosystem. If you don’t already have a DAM solution, take my word for it when I say you will. 

A good marketing operation can no longer function efficiently or profitably without one. In many ways, a DAM solution serves as the single command center from which you control your marketing content and make it available to others. 

Widen has a great whitepaper about the Rise of the Marketing Technologist if you’re looking for a good read on the topic.</p>

        <p>“The best marketers will have ever more consumer data, capable of faster adaptation, shorter lead times, and always-on, real-time marketing.”

Good marketers have always been adaptable. But agility adds an element of iteration to the equation. If you’re capable of being nimble, flexible, and iterative, then you’re really winning (insert Charlie Sheen smile here). 

In terms of digital asset management, the good solution providers not only take an iterative approach to their product development, they enable marketers to also be more agile by providing features and functionality for easy capture and output of data. In turn, organizations can use that data to constantly improve their marketing campaigns.

        <p>“Personalization is not a trend. It is a marketing tsunami, here to stay, which will transform how we think about and how we manage global brands.”

Thanks to social media, streaming data, news feeds, and mobile devices, the average consumer is accustomed to having content aggregated and served to them when, where, and how they choose. So I think Dan is right to suggest the continued evolution of this concept will push marketers to focus more on how they manage their brands.

Making the right brand assets easy to find, sharing brand assets safely, and tracking asset usage across multiple locations will become more and more of a priority for marketers. No doubt one of the best ways to manage your brand is, and will continue to be, with a good DAM solution. </p>

            <p>To sum up the article, Dan says, “the single biggest challenge that marketers will need to solve is how to scale content in an economic way.”

DAM solutions are now able to scale much easier with the needs of businesses. Cloud-based solutions make storage of assets more cost-effective and allow organizations to grow the amount and type of assets they manage over time. Digital assets ARE pieces of visual content and digital asset management will be imperative in helping organizations economically automate their marketing workflows in order to better manage, share, and analyze their content.

Truthfully, there’s no better time to be in marketing. In the next five years, we’ll see some of the biggest changes the industry has ever experienced. And if you’re ready to get agile, there’s no better time to be developing marketing technologies.</p>
