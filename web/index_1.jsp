					<p class="font1 pad_bot1 pad_top1"><strong>Do we have to keep printed purchase orders?</strong></p>
					<p> 
We are trying to eliminate more paper from our organisation and would like to know whether
we have to keep printed purchase orders. Common wisdom says that, as legal documents,
they have to be kept for seven years. Can we rely on our computer records only? And what
would the situation be if we faxed purchase orders directly from our system with no hard copy
ever being printed?
Dick Jennings writes: Length of storage is a tricky issue. Why seven years? It sounds a
completely arbitrary choice, but there are sensible reasons. Six years is the limitation period
for claims for breach of contract to be litigated, so seven years is safely beyond the point that
your purchase orders could be in dispute with suppliers. And six years is also as far back as
the Inland Revenue can (other than in cases of fraud) reopen your tax affairs.
Certain records have to be kept in a paper form, mostly where they are affected by legislation
that predates the electronic age. The government has wide powers under the Electronic
Communications Act 2000 to start updating these laws, but it will be a slow process.
For the rest, records such as purchase orders simply have to be good enough to convince the
auditor, the Inland Revenue, and - if the subject of court action - the courts. There is no reason
in principle why they should not be in electronic form.
Faxing purchase orders direct from your system, with no hard copy, raises the issue of
whether your records are adequate in the first place. Two points here. First, unlike orders sent
by mail, you have no “postal rule” to give you the benefit of the doubt as to whether, once sent,
they ever reach your supplier. It is therefore essential to keep fax transmission reports.
Second, what happens to your standard terms of purchase? When orders are faxed, purchase
terms tend to get lost, either because they’re on the back of the form and aren’t transmitted or
because they are illegible. If you fax directly from your computer system, you should ensure
that you send legible terms of purchase with every order.</p>
					<p class="font1 pad_bot1"><strong> How should a purchaser respond to a request from a supplier for an
unscheduled price rise?</strong></p>
					<p>
The supplier needs to give reasons for the price rise. It may, for example, be due to a natural
disaster such as the earthquake in Japan. This caused serious disruption to the manufacture
of components for export to Europe, which had a knock-on effect on the final market price of
UK products.
First consider if there is a formal contract in place, and if so, what the terms regarding price
fluctuation are. If the contract stipulates a fixed price, the purchaser should remind the
supplier of this but should also be willing to explore how both parties can reach a win-win
situation, thus preserving the supply chain relationship and stability.
If a compromise can’t be reached, the supplier may have to pull out of the deal.
The purchaser should be aware of the risks to the organisation if the contract breaks down -
the products being supplied may be vital to the infrastructure of the business, for example. In
the case of a manufacturer, any interruption to the supply of a raw material or component
could affect the production line and profitability.
Proactive negotiation to maintain the contract relationship is the best course of action. While
the organisation may be unable to accept an increase in price, the breakdown of the contract
should be viewed as a last resort.</p>
					<p class="font1 pad_bot1"><strong>Do I pay for the tender documents?</strong></p>
					<p>
a) Check with the Buyer department. Few departments insist Vendors to remit
the cost towards Tender Form Fee and then obtain the tender documents.
b) Some departments allow you to download the tender documents at the time
of online request itself. Initially all the tender documents are issued free of
cost, but while submitting the tender, you need to enter the DD details of
Tender form fee, etender processing fees, wherever applicable. </p>
				<p class="font1 pad_bot1"><strong>How do I upload and attach my additional certificates to the tenders?</strong></p>
                                <p>
You can upload all your certificates or documents through "General Documents”
link. This link acts as a library where you can store any number of documents/
certificates at any point of time. These certificates can be attached to any
number of tenders (for attaching the file through “General Document” link, see
help file).
In case you are facing any problem of not uploading the general documents, then
open your image file in MS Paint, go to Image >> Stretch/Skew >> Reduce the size
of the image to 50% >> save image and then try to upload the same. </p>
