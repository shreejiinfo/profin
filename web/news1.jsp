                                                    <strong class="color1">The worst Android 5.0 (Lollipop) bugs and their fixes</strong></p>
                                                
                                                <p>Android 5.0 Lollipop is here and while you might be rejoicing at all the new features you can take advantage of, you might also be cursing at the state that the new OS has left your device in.

We've rounded up the most common Lollipop issues so far, together with the fixes you can try to get your gadgets working smoothly again.</p>
        
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Issue: Wi-Fi connectivity</strong></p>
       <p>Some Android 5.0 users have been reporting dropped internet connections, while others can't get online at all. Older devices like Nexus 5 and Nexus 10 seem to be having the most problems.

In some cases, these are known bugs inside Lollipop, and you're going to have to wait for Google's engineers to get around to pushing out a software update, but there are some tricks you can try in the meantime.</p>
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Fixes</strong></p>
       <p>In terms of suggested fixes, getting your phone or tablet to forget the network (long-press on the Wi-Fi network list), then reconnecting seems to work for a select few. The old faithful factory reset has done the trick for some, but this is a bit of a pain to work through.

You might also want to uninstall some of the older apps on your device, at least temporarily: A number of users have reported Wi-Fi issues disappearing once particular third-party apps were updated with Lollipop compatibility. If you're running an older app that hasn't been updated in a while, it could be causing interference.

Rebooting devices and the home router is another troubleshooting fix you might want to try. We've seen other reports that changing the Wi-Fi channel can improve performance: It's under the Advanced option on the Wi-Fi screen menu, or you can adjust the channel settings from your router.</p>
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Issues: Low battery life</strong></p>
       <p>Battery issues are rumoured to have held up the rollout of Lollipop and it looks like Google wasn't able to squash all the bugs before the new OS saw the light of day.

Battery problems appear to be even more common than Wi-Fi ones based on the forum and social media posts we've seen, though once you have got everything working correctly Android 5.0 should in theory give your device better battery life.</p>
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Fixes</strong></p>
       <p>The factory reset has been known to help out some users.

Then there's the problem of older apps that haven't been updated since Lollipop appeared on the scene. One of these apps might be clashing with Lollipop's new code and causing the battery to drain unnecessarily, so you might want to try removing a few apps that haven't been recently updated. Remember you can see which apps are using up your device's juice from the Battery page in Settings.

You can also switch settings like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, uninstall specific apps and see what changes. 

Google has already pushed out an update to fix one battery life issue earlier this month, so make sure your version is up to date.</p>
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Issue: Lagging and crashing</strong></p>
       <p>Several Android 5.0 Lollipop users have complained of a noticeable dip in performance since the update. Not just sluggishness, the affected devices also crash while running some very common apps at random times.</p>
 
 <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Fixes</strong></p>
       <p>If one app seems to be at the root of the issue then the obvious next step is to uninstall it or check for an update. Head to the developer's support site to see if any bugs have been reported by users or the development team. As with any update, it may be that certain apps are having problems adjusting to a new Lollipop-powered way of life, and bringing the whole system down with them.

We've seen reports that switching off some of the bells and whistles that come with Android — Google Now, OK Google support, live wallpapers, and so on — can improve the situation. If your device is completely unusable then going back to KitKat for a while is a potential option.

At the risk of sounding repetitive it's worth mentioning a factory reset again, to clear the cobwebs away and enable your device to start afresh from scratch.</p>
 
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Issue: Video playback</strong></p>
       <p>One of the more specific problems to crop up on web forums is a video playback issue with the Wi-Fi version of the 2013 Nexus 7. Users are reporting that Lollipop is unable to find the video player software when they want to watch a clip.</p>
 
       
       <p class="pad_bot1">
                                                                     <strong class="color1">Fixes</strong></p>
       <p>Clearing the cache of one of the affected apps (such as YouTube) has helped some people restore functionality. You can do this from the Apps page in Settings.

Other users have found success by enabling or disabling the NuPlayer from the Developer options page (this seems to be a new, experimental playback layer introduced with Lollipop). Head to About phone from the Settings app and tap the build number seven times to activate the developer options screen, and you can then try playing around with NuPlayer. If it's enabled then disable it and vice versa, resetting your device each time.

Other than that you can fall back on the factory reset option which will wipe all temporary data from your device and may be enough to restore video playback functionality.</p>
